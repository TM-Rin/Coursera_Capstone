I would like to find best places to open new cafeteria in the biggest city in my country - Moscow.*\n\nMoscow city have aproximate 2500 square km area and nearly 13 million population.\nFor people who want to start new business, in our example a cafeteria, it is quite hard to find a \"good place\".\n\n\"Good place\" is a broad term, it is including:\n- flow of people\n- location of other cafeterias around\n- location of parks and other zones where people can buy coffee with them and enjoy a walk there\n- location of business centers and living quaters\n- good view from cafeteria\n- etc\n\nFor business which mostly work with people, finding a place with big flow of people and many other positive factors is a half a success."
